	<td> <p>A Curriculum Vitae, or CV for short, is a professional document that summarizes your work history, education, and skills. The main purpose of a CV is to sell you, as a candidate, to prospective employers. When applying for a position, you're always going to be asked for a CV, coupled with a cover letter.
    Curriculum Vitae (CV) is Latin for "course of life." In contrast, resume is French for "summary." Both CVs & Resumes: Are tailored for the specific job/company you are applying to. Should represent you as the best qualified candidate.The term curriculum vitae and its abbreviation, CV, are also used especially in academia to refer to extensive or even complete summaries of a person's career, qualifications, and education, including publications and other information. This has caused the widespread misconception that it is incorrect to refer to short CVs as CVs in American English and that short CVs should be called résumés, but this is not supported by the usage recorded in American dictionaries.[citation needed] For example, the University of California, Davis notes that "in the United States and Canada, CV and resume are sometimes used interchangeably" while describing the common distinction made in North-American academia between the use of these terms to refer to documents with different contents and lengths.

In many countries, a short CV is typically the first information that a potential employer receives from a job-seeker, and CVs are typically used to screen applicants, often followed by an interview. CVs may also be requested for applicants to postsecondary programs, scholarships, grants, and bursaries. In the 2010s it became popular for applicants to provide an electronic version of their CV to employers by email, through an employment website, or published on a job-oriented social-networking service such as LinkedIn.</td></p>
